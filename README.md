## LED Strip

Make sure you have npm and nodejs installed.

Just run npm install to get your dependencies installed

If you are using Atom, it helps to have a terminal installed like platformio-ide-terminal

To start:
1. Make sure you have setup your Arduino Board (https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five/wiki/Getting-Started)

Change line 16 in led.js to find the word that YOU want to search for.

2. Run the code:

    node ./src/led.js

Watch the tweets come in!
Watch your led strip light up
